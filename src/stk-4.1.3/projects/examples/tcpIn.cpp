/*
  Example program to read N channels of audio
  data that are streamed over a TCP network
  connection.

  by Gary P. Scavone, 2000

  This program is currently written to play
  the input data in realtime.  However, it
  is simple to replace the instance of
  RtWvOut with WvOut for writing to a
  soundfile.

  The streamed data format is assumed to be
  signed 16-bit integers.  However, both
  TcpWvIn and TcpWvOut can be initialized
  to read/write any of the defined STK_FORMATs.

  The class TcpWvIn sets up a socket server
  and waits for a connection.  Therefore,
  this program needs to be started before
  the streaming client.  This program will
  terminate when the socket connection is
  closed.
