The <B>Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)</B> is a set of open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in C++.  STK was designed to facilitate rapid development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with an emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of use, and educational example code.  The Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable (it's mostly platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's completely user-extensible (all source included, no unusual libraries, and no hidden drivers).  We like to think that this increases the chances that our programs will still work in another 5-10 years.  In fact, the ToolKit has been working continuously for nearly 8 years now.  STK currently runs with "realtime" support (audio and MIDI) on SGI (Irix), Linux, Macintosh OS X, and Windows computer platforms.  Generic, non-realtime support has been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and should work with any standard C++ compiler.
