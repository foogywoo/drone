/*! \page system System Requirements

<B>General:</B>
<UL>
<LI>A MIDI interface to use MIDI input controls. (NOTE: This may be built into the soundcard on your computer.)</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com">Tcl/Tk</A> version 8.0 or higher to use the simple Tcl/Tk GUIs provided with the STK distribution (available free over the WWW for all supported realtime platforms).</LI>
</UL>

<B>Linux (specific):</B>
<UL>
<LI>A soundcard to use realtime audio input/output capabilities.  In order to use the <I><B>effects</B></I> project, the soundcard and drivers must support full duplex mode.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.opensound.com">OSS</A> or <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</A> device drivers for realtime sound output and MIDI input.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Macintosh OS X (specific):</B>
<UL>
<LI>A C++ compiler does not ship by default with OS X.  It is necessary to download the Developer Kit from the Apple WWW site in order to compile STK.</LI>
<LI><B>IMPORTANT:</B>The internal Macintosh audio hardware typically supports a sample rate of 44100 Hz only.  Therefore, it is necessary to either specify this rate as a command-line option to the STK example programs or to change the default sample rate inside the Stk.h file before compilation.  In addition, the RT_BUFFER_SIZE, specified in Stk.h, could be increased (to a higher power of two) for more robust performance.</LI>
<LI>The tcl/tk interpreter does not ship by default with OS X, but must be downloaded from the internet.  The latest Tcl/Tk Aqua distribution (http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltk.html) has been successfully tested on a 10.2 system.  The default installation will place a link to the wish interpretor at /usr/bin/wish.

Initial tests have shown somewhat poor response between changes made in the tcl/tk script and the resulting audio updates.  It is possible to connect a tcl/tk interface to an STK program via a socket connection.  However, the tcl/tk interpreter does not appear to properly close the socket connection during disconnection.  It is therefore necessary to type "Exit" in the STK program terminal window to properly exit the STK program.</LI>

</UL>

<B>Windows95/98/2000/XP (specific):</B>
<UL>
<LI>A soundcard to use realtime audio input/output capabilities.  In order to use the <I><B>effects</B></I> project, the soundcard and drivers must support full duplex mode.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">DirectX</A> 5.0 (or higher) runtime libraries to use the precompiled binaries.</LI>
<LI>Visual C++ 6.0 for compiling (though a precompiled distribution is available).</LI>
<LI>For compiling the source (if not already in your system): <UL><LI><A HREF="Misc/dsound.h">dsound.h</A> header file (DirectX 6.1) - put somewhere in your header search path</LI><LI><A HREF="Misc/dsound.lib">dsound.lib</A> library file (DirectX 6.1) - put somewhere in your library search path</LI></UL></LI>
</UL>

<B>WindowsNT (specific):</B>
<UL>
<LI>DirectX support for NT is inadequate, so it is not possible to use STK under WindowsNT with realtime DirectX support.  It may be possible to use STK under WindowsNT with realtime ASIO support, though this has not been tested.</LI>
</UL>
